# React-Electron Baseline
This repo is intended to be a quick way of getting up and running with a new electron app
which uses React instead of regular JS.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. run `cd src; npm run install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run start` to launch the app in dev mode
4. Run `npm run build` to build the react app, and then the installer for the app. The installer is found under dist/"app Setup 0.1.0"
